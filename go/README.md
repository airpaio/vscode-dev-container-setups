## VS-Code Remote Container Setup for Go Projects

Anywhere you see the string `go_project`, you can replace with the name of your project/repository.


### Get Started With New Go Module

Init the module with 

`go mod init example.com/module/name`

where you can replace with the code repository path like `github.com/Orgainzation/Project`

Then start writing code.

### Features

* `Makefile` to hold build commands and other scripts for development - especially useful for pipelines
* **AWS CLI** If you use other cloud providers or need other CLIs you can add/replace - especially useful with make commands
